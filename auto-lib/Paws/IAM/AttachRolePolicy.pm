=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::AttachRolePolicy - Arguments for method AttachRolePolicy on Paws::IAM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AttachRolePolicy on the 
AWS Identity and Access Management service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AttachRolePolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AttachRolePolicy.

As an example:

  $service_obj->AttachRolePolicy(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and

=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleName => Str

The name (friendly name, not ARN) of the role to attach the policy to.
